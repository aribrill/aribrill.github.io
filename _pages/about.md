I'm an independent AI safety researcher working to improve humanity's scientific knowledge of advanced AI systems. My research currently focuses on creating mathematical and empirical models to study how AI systems develop internal representations of the world. My work is supported by a grant from the [Long-Term Future Fund](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future) (EA Funds).

Previously, I was a NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellow at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. At NASA, I used deep learning and statistical analysis to investigate high-energy extragalactic astrophysics, focusing on modeling the variability of gamma-ray emission powered by supermassive black holes.

I completed my PhD in Physics at Columbia in 2021. For my [thesis](https://doi.org/10.7916/d8-jznf-8e64), I studied extremely variable blazars using very-high-energy gamma-ray telescopes and developed experimental control software and analysis methods using deep neural networks to improve next-generation instruments.
Before that, I completed a B.S. in Physics at Yale in 2015.
