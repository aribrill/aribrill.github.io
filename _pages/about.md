I'm currently a [NASA Postdoctoral Program](https://npp.orau.org/) Fellow at [NASA Goddard Space Flight Center](https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/astrophysics/).
I apply artificial intelligence and statistical analysis to high-energy extragalactic astrophysics.
My research has recently focused on creating models to explain the dramatic variability of the gamma rays produced around supermassive black holes.

I completed my PhD in Physics at Columbia in 2021, advised by Prof. [Reshmi Mukherjee](https://barnard.edu/profiles/reshmi-mukherjee) in the [VERITAS/CTA group](https://veritas.astro.columbia.edu/).
For my [thesis](https://doi.org/10.7916/d8-jznf-8e64), I studied extremely variable blazars using very-high-energy gamma-ray telescopes and developed experimental control software and analysis methods using deep neural networks to improve next-generation instruments.
Before that, I completed a B.S. in Physics at Yale in 2015.
